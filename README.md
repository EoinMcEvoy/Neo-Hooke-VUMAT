# Neo-Hooke-VUMAT
Abaqus VUMAT fortran subroutine for a Neo-Hookean material

Download the subroutine and run with the .inp file in Abaqus

Alter neo-hookean material properties (C10, D1) within the input file as required

Subroutine has not been robustly tested but computes the same stress as the in-built Abaqus material law in several single-element simulations
